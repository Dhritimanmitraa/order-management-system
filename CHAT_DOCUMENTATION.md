## Assistant Response
Looking at your Order Management System project, I'll help create a comprehensive documentation of our development journey in PDF format. The documentation will include our complete conversation history showing the step-by-step development process, from initial project setup through implementation of features, debugging sessions, and deployment configuration. The format will maintain a clear chronological order of our interactions while preserving the context of each development phase and technical decisions made during the process.

This documentation captures our conversation about creating a PDF format of our chat history for the Order Management System project.
